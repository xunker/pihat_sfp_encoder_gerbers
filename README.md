# PiHat SFP "encoder" Gerbers, Renamed

This is nothing more than the Gerber files from PcDwarf's [PiHat SFP "encoder"](https://hackaday.io/project/21725-pihat-sfp-encoder)
project, with the filenames changed so they are properly recognized by online PCB fabs such as OshPark, DirtyPCBs, PCBWay, JLCpcb, etc.

The files from the original all had the _.gbr_ extension. I've renamed them following the OshPark and DirtyPCB recommendations, and added descriptions to the filenames.

## Using this Repo

For all other uses, please zip up the contents of this directory (but not the directory itself).

### Drill File

The files _sfpflashV3_Tr-drills.xln_ and _sfpflashV3_Tr-drills.drl_ are the **same file**.

DirtyPCBs wants the _.drl_ extension while most others are happy with _.xln_.
